This repository contains code for preprocessing and sorting lung ultrasound (LUS) image datasets and building image processing pipelines for automated classification of lung diseases using AI techniques.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is increasingly recognized as a valuable imaging modality for evaluating various pulmonary conditions. It is a radiation-free, cost-effective, and portable diagnostic tool—especially well-suited for use in low-resource and emergency settings. However, accurate interpretation of LUS scans remains challenging due to high inter-operator variability, dependence on sonographer expertise, and the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio of ultrasound images.

To address these challenges, this project supports the development of AI-based diagnostic tools that can help automate and standardize LUS interpretation. It focuses on two key components:

- `sort_lus_data.py`: Organizes and structures raw ultrasound datasets for streamlined training and evaluation.
- `process_image.py`: Provides image preprocessing and transformation functions to prepare input data for machine learning pipelines.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

This repository supports a curated benchmark dataset of 1,062 labelled lung ultrasound images collected in Uganda. The data were acquired from patients at **Mulago National Referral Hospital** and **Kiruddu Referral Hospital** by senior radiologists. Each image is annotated and suitable for training and evaluating deep learning models—particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

The dataset is intended to support the development of robust, automated deep learning systems for pulmonary disease diagnosis using LUS. It offers valuable real-world data for advancing medical AI research, especially in under-resourced clinical environments.

## Getting Started
- Clone the Repository
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lung-ultrasound-ai-disease-classification.git
cd lung-ultrasound-ai-disease-classification
```

- Organize Your Dataset
  > Ensure your raw LUS images are placed in the correct input folder, then run:

```bash
python sort_lus_data.py
```
This will sort and structure the dataset into appropriate subfolders for training and evaluation.

- Preprocess the Images
